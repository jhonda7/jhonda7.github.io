In the spring of 2016, I gave a talk at the annual Hawaii Ophthalmologic Society meeting on a case study of postoperative necrotizing scleritis (pictured above with corneal graft). Postoperative necrotizing scleritis is an aggresive infection caused by a strain of bacteria that necrotizes, or decomposes, the scleral tissue. The scleral tissue decays and in serious cases can lead to blindness. This condition occurs in a large percentege of patients who under go intraocular or even topological excision-type surgeries. The case study at this talk focused on a patient on whom the Ophthalmologist I had been shadowing at the time performed a pterygium excision. The patient later developed a case of post operative necrotizing scleritis. The talk overviewed the stages of: recognition and diagnosis, treatments, potential complications, and prognosis all aiming to highlight to other physicians the necessity and delicacy involved in post-surgical care.

My role involved reviewing several published studies detailing how other physicians tackled the infection. After reading through studies I met with my advising physician and de-breifed the meaning of the findings. The Ophthalmologist that I was shadowing allowed me 50% of speaking time. While she presented the case and her reccomendations, I was allowed to brief the audience on (1) What is post operative necrotising scleritis, (2) Present the research and findings from various case studies, and (3) Present a comparitive analysis between the treatment options (ours vs. research findings).

This experience taught me many things, among them: accountability, time-managment, and communication skills. I learned how to read and analyze scientific studies, how to interperet large amounts of data, how to interperet and handle 'extreme cases' in the dat. I was apprehensive in my own ability to give a talk to an audience of medical doctors, but with generous guidance from my advising physician I was able to deliver an informative and engaging talk.
