In 2017 I had played a small role in the beginning of starting a non-profit organization. This organization is tied to my student teaching experience. The initial goal of this non-profit was to raise awarness of the prevalance of skin cancer and to raise funds to build a permanent shade structure for an eat Oahu elementary school.

I researched articles of incorporation and necessary tax forms required to esablish a non-profit. I also volunteered my time to sell various sun-health related products to raise sun-health awareness. I was assigned to handle customer transactions and experience.
