JavaScript, so far, rocks. This is coming from someone whose first language was C. Don't get me wrong, C is amazing. But JavaScript feels like a mirage: too good to be true. As you can tell from the title, the most shocking thing I found was the lack of formality when declaring functions. In fact, I was hardwired to think that you must ALWAYS specify what your code is doing so you can always expect what is going to happen. Not having to declare a return type, not going to lie, makes me feel uneasy. This leads me to my next point, just how good is JavaScript for software engineering?

I by no means am a professional, nor do I claim to be. I can't tell you about all of the security features JavaScript may or may not have but what I do know if that JavaScript feels like I've just loosened my belt buckles and don't have to be so strict with my code. Now that i'm saying it, this sounds like a really bad idea. JavaScript might just ruin every other language (maybe not Python), and when it's time to go back to stricted languages it'll probably be met with some resistance, making it all the harder to be an all around proficient coder.

Perhaps the point of software engineering is not to be proficient in as many languages as possible but to understand the abstraction of what's going on (Data structures and objects, etc) and do a handful of languages really well. That makes sense, right? If you're anything like me, a novice, then by all means: JavaScript is an amazing language - go for it!

Also, JavaScript makes the WOD's less intimidating. As mentioned above, not having to worry about return types when returning from a function is pretty amazing. but there are many other ways that are simplified by JavaScript: declaring variables, passing argument types to functions, etc. Perhaps it is this simplicity that allows us to more effectively approach the athletic style of coding, not having to worry so much about syntax and types allow us to more clearly deal with the problem at hand and not any residual confusion with a strict language.

As an inherently anxious person, the WOD's do bring a lot of stress and anxiety (not to mention the fear of incompetence). But I do appreciate this method of periodically induced trauma. Cynicism aside, I'm willing to try my best on the WOD's with JavaScript. Like the title says: I've got 99 other problems, but thankfully worrying about a return type isn't one.
