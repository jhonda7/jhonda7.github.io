Starting in 2016 I bagan to shadow a board certified ophthalmologist and in 2017 I was also offered an opportunity to launch an initiative at an East Oahu elementary school geared at teaching the surrounding community about the importance of SPF or adequate protection from UV radiation. This project entailed me teaching an elementary school 5th grade class mathematics once a week for one semester at one hour intervals. The purpose of my teaching was to (1) create an algebra based curriculum for the semester (2) use the algebraic skills developed to track UV conditions around campus via an iOS app and iOS specified hardware. As a culminating project, I along with some teachers at the school, taught the students how to use computer design software to 3-d print model shade structures. One of these structures would be chosen and built on campus via a nonprofit organization. Pictured above is an example shade structure that provides ample UV protection at a school campus. (See this [project] for more information on my role in this nonprofit).

In December 2017, when my teaching officially came to a close, each student was able to interpret data, and manipulate the data algebraically (i.e central tendency calculations) to find the most effective place on campus to build a shade structure to guard faculty, staff, and students from UV radiation while at school. In 2018, a model structure was chosen and the structure was implemented on campus!

My role as a teacher included doing preliminary research on what lessons to include in my curriculum and coordinating with teachers at the school to gauge what the students were capable of. The preparation for this semester-long project took place three months before the start of the school year (May 2017). This was stressful at times, as this was the first time that I was incharge of a project that was monetarily funded. I was certain to meet all deadlines, show up to class early, and practice giving lectures in my own time. 

To ascertain the success of this project, I referenced many teachers within the community. I offered my curriculum and lesson plans and asked for feedback and was open to critique and made adjustments accordingly. This specific part of the project process taught me valuable skills that I will implement in my future co-working environment. This taught me how to make use of available resources, get input from others, and (subjectively) most importantly humility! I was open to being told that my ideas could be improved.

(Considering the vast majority of people do not wear sunscreen everyday).
