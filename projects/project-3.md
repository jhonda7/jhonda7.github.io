summary: I had a minor role in helping an ophthalmologist start a sun protection geared non-profit organization.

In 2017 I had played a small role in the beginning of starting a non-profit organization started by an ophthalmologist I was shadowing at the time. She started this nonprofit because she began noticing prevalent cases of UV induced eye trauma that caused unnecessary complications, surgeries, and treatments. Please, visit this [page](https://jhonda7.github.io/projects/HOS) about my role in a case study presentation on post operative necrotizing scleritis after a pterygium excision and to learn more about the role that UV exposure has on eye complications.

Additionally, skin cancer is one of the most prevalent types of cancer in the North American population. Yet it is one of the most preventable! This however, does not mean that it can not be deadly. Pictured above depicts the rapid progression of early stage melanoma, it does not look like much but this tumor has the potential to grow and metastasize. Please protect yourself and visit your PCP or dermatologist to evaluate any suspicious looking moles or skin growths and do your part to limit your exposure to UV radiation.

To address this, the initial goal of this non-profit was to raise awareness of skin cancer and educate community members on sun safety. The non-profit also aimed to raise funds to build a permanent shade structure for an east Oahu elementary school. (See this [page](https://jhonda7.github.io/projects/ST) for more information on that).

Although I had a relatively small part in this project, it certainly offered valuable learning opportunities. My part of the project was to research articles of incorporation and necessary tax forms required to establish a non-profit. This entailed me reaching out to local accountants and financial planners. In these meetings I needed to keep in mind that I represented the nonprofit and needed to handle these documents professionally and respectfully. This taught me valuable communication skills for interacting with others in a professional setting. This was something that I did have experience with prior, but was able to further practice a level of professionalism in the workplace. I am certain that it will be beneficial in my future work environment.
Lastly, this valuable experience taught me important skill sets needed to operate in a professional setting. I also managed to network within the community to gain insight and to expedite the formation of the non-profit, something that I am hoping to get involved with in the future!
