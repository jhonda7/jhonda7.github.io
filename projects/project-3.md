Skin cancer is one of the most prevalent types of cancer in the American population. Pictured above is early stage melanoma. In 2017 I had played a small role in the beginning of starting a non-profit organization. The initial goal of this non-profit was to raise awarness of the of skin cancer and educate community members to take skin cancer and skin protection seriously. The non-profit also aimed to raise funds to build a permanent shade structure for an east Oahu elementary school.

My part of the project, although small, was to researched articles of incorporation and necessary tax forms required to esablish a non-profit. I also volunteered my time to sell various sun-health related products to raise sun-health awareness and raise funds for the planned shade structure. I was assigned to handle customer transactions and experience. This experience got my feet wet in the world of business, particularily the process of incorporation.

This valuable experiece taught me important skillsets needed to facillitate potential businesses. I managed to network within the community to gain insight and to expedite the formation of the non-profit. I learned valuable business leadership skills as well and learned how to properly declare a non-profit organization.
