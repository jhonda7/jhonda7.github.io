I was always enthralled with the growing group of research and the amazing things computer sciences around the world were producing. Data extrapolations and predictions that I never thought one could ever publish and have accepted by any scientific body - but here we are in 2021 and the need for big data analysis has never been more in demand. (Yes, I’m talking to you COVID-19). 

Although I originally intended to go into medicine (very befitting now during a global pandemic), I found a deep admiration for all things ICS. I recall speaking to a software engineer about some of the things that some computer scientists are working on in response to the pandemic, different ways that we could create algorithms, and with proper implementation, we could have significantly slowed the spread of COVID-19. How? I’m not even certain, but that certainly planted a seed. We are often reminded of the amazing front-line health workers and their responsibility to care for those during this pandemic. However, I never thought about the profound impact some well written algorithms could do for the population that could also save lives.

I don’t know much about coding now, but what I do know is that software has the potential to drastically change the landscape of the future, and even save lives. For now, as a novice, I plan on learning and bettering myself as a problem-solver to respond and help those in need. Maybe this comes in the format of writing better algorithms or even just better communication skills, I’m not limiting myself to a set of expectations, rather I turn my attention to being open to different possibilities and interpretations.
